[ReSwift](https://github.com/ReSwift/ReSwift) take on a iOS application that shows trams and busses locations in Warsaw.

Go to `https://api.um.warszawa.pl` and get your own API key and create:

```swift
extension  WarsawApiConstants.ParamValue {
    static let APIKey = "your api key here"
}
```

anywhere in the project.
